% README file for the folder MatrixFunctions.
% This folder stores different MATLAB functions receiving a two-elements
% array and returning a 2-by-2 matrix. These functions are particularly 
% useful tovrepresent the viscosity matrix for the two-dimensional
% Poisson equation. Indeed, direct functions should be prefered to handle
% functions when performance matters.

% The available functions are listed hereunder:
