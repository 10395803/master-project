% driverLinearPoisson1dReduced Given the parametrized, linear one-dimensional
% Poisson equation $-u''(x) = f(x,\mu)$ defined on $[a,b]$, this script 
% performs the following tasks:
% - computing a discrete solution (snapshot) for different values of $\mu$
% - build a reduced basis out of the ensemble of snapshots
% - solve the full and reduced discrete model for other values of $\mu$
% - compute the error between full and reduced solution
% - store the results in a Matlab dataset
